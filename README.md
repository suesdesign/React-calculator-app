# Calculator app built with React

The app creates a simple calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The calculator is operated by clicking on numbers and operator buttons. The app features a display showing the calculation to be done, the completed calculation once the '=' button has been clicked and a 'clear' button to reset the output display to 0.

The project uses the math.js library for the calculation:
